Alternate access to the first section of the Colorado Trail will be from the west leg of the Indian Creek loop. (from comba.org)<br />
<br />
This section of the CT is undoubtedly the most travelled section both for hikers and mountain bikers. It is about 17 miles from the Waterton parking lot to the parking lot at South Platte.  The first 6 miles up Waterton Canyon is especially crowded, and is likely to be filled with children and weaving pedestrians.  Once you get to the Strontia dam, the trail begins it's upward journey for the next couple of miles up to the ""sitting bench.""  If you turn left you will be on the Roxborough Loop, and if you continue on past the bench (downhill) you will be on the Colorado Trail.  Only 460 miles to Durango!<br />
<br><br><br />
The singletrack is pretty sweet on this part of the trail, although this first descent is almost the only downhill you will do for about the next 8 miles!  You will encounter some pleasant forest covered trail, as well as some very rocky and technical uphill sections that are easier to walk than to ride.  On long distance rides you are better off walking some places rather than exert too much energy. You have to save something for the trip back!  Remember that as you plow into these steep hills...<br />
<br><br><br />
Once over a couple of these rocky sections, you will head into the open-to-motorcycles section of the trail, and the rocks get bigger and the trail gets even harder.  You WILL be walking parts of the trail here.  Again, this is mostly uphill...although it does eventually level out somewhat.  Overall, the grades are pretty easy on this trail and it is mostly ridable once you pass the motorcycle area.  Then begins a long steady climb with rolling hills and great views as you head west towards South Platte.<br><br><br />
At about mile 13 you will find yourself on the top of a rocky outcropping looking down on the river to the west.  This is the beginning of the last descent.  This one is MAJOR.  If you want an easy day, turn around here and head back to Waterton.  No one will think any less of you.  However, if you are up for a challenge, you can complete this section of the CO Trail by heading down what is nearly a 4 mile descent straight down.  Great fun as the trail is well maintained, and the switchbacks are all pretty ridable.  Your hands will burn from using the breaks and holding on for dear life as you blaze down this trail and finally emerge at the river.  As you turn around, you will be shocked at how far you dropped!  Congratulations, you have just completed section 1 of the Colorado Trail!<br />
<br><br><br />
It is best to carry a water filter, as you might find yourself on the edge of your water allowance on the return trip.  This is important as now you are looking at a 4 mile climb to get out of the valley and get back to Waterton!  After a rest, you can begin the ascent and hopefully survive the climb without too much walking (some of the switchbacks are a bit tricky when going uphill).  Note the joy on the faces of those downhillers speeding by you, and remember a happier time when that was you!  Honestly, the grade is not terrible and although long, most of this ascent is not that bad.  If you do OK on Mt. Falcon or Deer Creek, you will probably have no trouble here.  <br />
<br><br><br />
Now, once you knock out that climb, you are looking at a great ride back towards Waterton.  For the first several miles you have rolling singletrack that is a pure joy to coast down.  I would estimate that for about 5 miles the trail is rolling singletrack, until it eventually goes back into the motorcycle area.  Going down is much easier, despite the large rocks in the trail.  You will also be able to go down the steeper hills at the end of this stretch if you don't mind loose, steep, rocky trail.  At the very end, you will have one last ascent that can be a bit of a burner after all you've been through to this point (about 25 miles of trail behind you).  When done, you will be back up to the resting bench...at which point it is all downhill and dirt road back to Waterton parking lot.  Total mileage should be around 34 miles to do the out and back.",Begin at the Waterton Canyon parking lot.  This lot is about 4 miles south of C-470 on Wadsworth Blvd.  It is easy to spot because the trail and parking lot is usually quite busy.,Littleton,Colorado,United States,39.49136,-105.09323,Advanced,Night riding allowed,4.63,https://images.singletracks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2013-07-29175139-orig.jpg
287305,Indian Creek Loop,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/indian-creek-loop/,29.0,"The first and last 6 miles of this trail are on the gravel road that goes through Waterton Canyon, meaning your total off-road trail distance will be about 17 miles (29 miles total).  Nonetheless, there is a lot of climbing and some route finding skills required, which means this ride has the potential to be MUCH longer than you anticipate.  If you carry a good map with you, there should be few problems.  If you grab the Trails Illustrated Map #135 for Deckers and Rampart Range, it has a blowup view of this entire trail system on the back and shows the loop almost perfectly.<br><br>

The first 6 miles will take you up to the dam.  You will continue on up the fire road until it ends and changes into singletrack (beginning the Colorado Trail).  This will continue to climb for about another mile until you reach the bench at the top.  From here you will notice a trail spur on the left just before you reach the bench, heading uphill.  This begins a short, but intense climb to the next intersection which is about º mile or so from the bench.  At this intersection you will notice the trail going left (back to Waterton) or to the right (uphill) heading onto the Indian Creek Loop.  Begin climbing once again as the trail strives to get to the ridgeline for about the next half mile or so.  You will finally reach a steep, loose section of trail which goes straight up, then to the left.  Once you clear this nasty section, it levels off from there.  This will be the last of the really bad climbs for quite some time.<br><br>

Now that you are on the ridgeline, the trail does some gentle uphills interspersed with slight descents.  Eventually you will roll off the east side of the hill and a quick, but steep descent puts you at a T intersection.  Note that the left trail is NOT on the trails illustrated map.  If you turn left into Stevens Gulch, this will take you down a fun, fast descent back towards the Roxborough Loop (make sure you make a left when you reach the homestead!).  If you turn right at this T, this will continue you on the journey towards the Indian Creek campground (the mid-way point of this ride).  Now, the trail becomes a fun downhill as it tracks down to the creek bed.  Once you reach that point, you will start to gradually go back up as you follow the creek for another mile or so.  This is a very scenic portion of the ride, and nice and cool in the shade of the forest.  There will be some tiring climbs as you get closer to the campground, but they are mostly just long grinds on easy terrain.  After a final little rock obstacle, you will be in the campground.<br><br>

From here, proceed to the latrine and potable water faucet.  You should see the clearly marked singletrack peeling off to the left, up the hill.  Once you refill your water, head back up the trail and begin another set of climbs.  Note that this section of trail is NOT on the trails illustrated map.  The grade here is pretty gentle, although you will be going uphill until you reach the fire road.  There will be several roads/trails at this intersection, but only one should be marked with the Indian Creek signage (as you come off the singletrack, look straight across and to the left down the hill).  This next section is on a fire road, but it is fast and fun because most of it goes downhill from this point.  You will come to a few odd intersections, but the trail is well marked the whole way.  At one Y intersection there was some deliberation on our route because the sign has an arrow which points between the two roadsÖbut at this point you want to go up to the left.  The left route was also well used in comparison to the right fork.<br><br>

As you get closer to the Roxborough State Park, beware of the huge ìspeed bumpsî someone has put in all along the trail.  These really are big jumps, but they are at odd intervals and around corners so they may take you by surprise if you arenít paying attention.  Because of their sharp angles, they are extremely dangerous to hit at even medium speed.  One guy in the group riding ahead of us broke his collarbone because he took these just slightly too fast. The fire road eventually begins to return to singletrack, especially once you reach the power lines.  At this point, you will get some incredible singletrack, blasting you through the forest as you cheer in delight.  You absolutely cannot miss the signage once you enter the State Park, but the singletrack generally continues along the creek bed here.  Your fun will end as you reach another tough climb out of the canyon (luckily it is rather short).  Your journey will go downhill again from here, and at one point you will come to an incredible meadow with just a ribbon of singletrack laid out before you.  If you can force yourself to stop, this is a great place for a snapshot!<br><br>

Once you reach the creek crossing, you will begin one more little set of climbs as you get ready to go back down into Waterton Canyon.  Once you start the downhill again, it doesnít let up until you are back down at the Waterton Canyon gravel road.  This section of trail is like a loose chute with lots of dust and loose rocksÖbut it can be a lot of fun as well.  There will be one intersection you pass with a trail going off to your left as you get back on the Roxborough Loop, but just continue straight downhill rather than making a left.  The signs all point you towards Waterton Canyon from here.  Once we popped out, we all agreed that despite the amount of climbing we suffered through, the payoff was well worth the effort.  Iím not sure if there is any merit in doing the loop in the reverse direction, although it is worth mentioning that I canít recall passing anyone in all those miles going the opposite direction.  Also note this is an equestrian loop as well, so best practice is to dismount when you see horses, pull off the trail and be friendly to them.  ","Wadsworth Blvd south of C470 for about 3 miles.

287431,Colorado Trail: South Platte To Buffalo Creek,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/colorado-trail-south-platte-to-buffalo-creek/,20.0,"The initial climb out of the parking lot is by far the hardest part of this section of the Colorado Trail.  Within the past several years, a re-routed portion of trail was created and if you carry a map with you, it might show the trail going northwest, instead of the correct southwest.  However, the trail is very well marked and easy to follow.  Once the initial mile or so of climbing on pea gravel is out of the way, the degree of steepness does ease up somewhat, although this trail continues gradually upward for many more miles.  While we were prepared to do some climbing, this section of the CT really kept it coming.<br><br>
Luckily, the grade is never too steep so that you should be able to grind up most of this trail.  The first 1/3 of this trail is burned out from a recent forest fire, and is quite interesting to ride through.  The second 1/3 of the trail is normal forest, while the last 1/3 is back in the burn zone (you will cross a fire road at one point, and although the trail has no markers on the other side, you DO want to cross the road and continue on the singletrack).  The last 1/3 is definitely more level, although you will encounter a variety of ups and downs and at times, some very fast singletrack!  The final mile from Hwy 126 to the Little Scraggy Trailhead (where many park for rides into Buffalo Creek area) is nice and flat doubletrack.<br><br>
The trip back from Little Scraggy is where this section of trail really shines.  On the return, your first 1/3 is fun ups and downs, the middle 1/3 has one short uphill section which will be the last of the climbing for the day...and the last 1/3 is pure downhill for what seems like forever!  This is payback for all the climbing you had to do on the way in... None of this trail is particularly technical, and most of it is well traveled and well worn.  Naturally you can get some pretty good speed going since your visibility in the burn zone is fairly distant. <br><br>
You will need to bring as much water as you can, especially in the summer months, as there are no water sources on this section of trail.  If all goes wrong, you can bail out on Hwy 126 and head down the hill back to the ""town"" of Buffalo Creek (and take the gravel road back to your car).  If you have a water filter, you can water up at that point.  However, all effort should be made to ride this trail in both directions, as the return back down the hill is really worthwhile.  Set aside 3-4 hours to do the entire route.  More if you like to stop, enjoy the scenery, etc.","The trailhead is at a place called South Platte, although this is really just a parking area rather than a village.  The easiest way to get there is probably Hwy 285 to Pine Junction, then Hwy 126 to Buffalo Creek, then make a left down the gravel road (following the river) and head east/se for about 10 miles.

<br />
With about 4 miles of flowy cross country trails ringing the park and littered with practice features, it is a great place to go for an in-town mountain bike ride or to introduce newbies to the sport. <br />

But the main feature is the jump lines.

Valmont is a great place to bring the family for a fun day at a bike-themed park. There is a “tot track” that is an easy spot for tots to push their bikes around, there’s also picnic tables and a snack machine nearby as well as playground equipment for when the tots get bored of the bikes.<br />

There's a total of about 17 miles of trail open to MTBs. You can do it all without repeating yourself much. The full meal deal will have you hitting about 3K verts at altitude, so it's more than just a ride in the park. This is a great exercise/training ride, with some great scenery. But it's really a lot like doing nearby Buffalo Creek with all the climbing but not all the fun. Park is hugely busy on weekends, I recommend doing the Marmot Passage trail clockwise for a more doable climb followed by hitting the best techy bits in the park on the descent. I also recommend doing the Borderline/Mason Creek Trail combo clockwise. The climb up borderline is quite heinous, but this is the only way to bet the longest fast and flowy downhill in the park.

Blackjack is a gnarly freeride area that is tough in the easiest of spots and downright extreme in the most technical. Major trail features are labeled with ratings going up to double black diamond. Major features include steep chutes, drops up to five feet, chunky rock gardens, and steep slickrock rolls. Some sections have blue or green bypasses (although take note: blue and green by Blackjack standards is black by other standards), but many do not. Always ride in control and be sure to scout out the serious features before you ride them.","From Colorado Springs, take US 24 to Woodland Park. Turn right onto CO 67 and go to Deckers.

287357,Heil Valley Ranch,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/heil-valley-ranch/,14.0,"There are currently 13.5 miles of bike-legal trails at Heil Valley ranch, but in order to ride all of them at once you’d have to do at least 23-24 miles of pedaling. The trail system is basically laid out with a figure 8 around the top of the mountain/ridge, and an out-and-back trail running up to it from the north and one from the south. The trailhead location given here, and one of the most popular rides, is to ride from the southern trailhead, up the 2.5-mile trail, around some of the trails on top, and back down. The out-and-back trail coming in from the north is 5.5 miles one-way, so riding from the northern trailhead would make for a longer ride… and riding absolutely everything would make for a grueling experience with tons of climbing.<br />
<br />
But all of that climbing is worth it, though! The trails here sport that characteristic Front Range rockiness, with plenty of chunk to pedal through on the climb up and around the upper trails. However, there are a few buff sections of trail thrown in at random, and none of the rocks are seriously big. It is all very easy to pedal through, and by Front Range standards is probably only intermediate in difficulty.<br />
<br />
Once at the top, be sure to take in the amazing views of the Front Range! Then get ready to descend. The descent back down is what it’s all about, and despite all of the rocks these trails sport some serious flow! All of the undulations, grade reversals, and swooping turns are just perfect, allowing you to carry some serious speed. But since both of the trails climbing to the top are ridden out-and-back, be sure to watch for oncoming traffic and to always ride in control. This trail is very popular, so keep your eyes peeled and don’t get too crazy… but have fun, because the bomb back down is awesome!","From Boulder, go North on Highway 36 to Lefthand Canyon Road, turn left here.

junctions, just follow the signs to stay on 835.<br />
After a lot of fun rocky sections of both up and downhill, and <br />
some nice views,  after a while you'll hit a wide open area with a big trailhead sign with a map and everything.  You can follow the dirt road back downhill to where you started, there's only one intersection you veer right on.<br />
OR instead of going down the dirt road, I think you can keep <br />
going straight across the dirt road for another mile to a <br />
dirt road that will also take you back where you started, <br />
double check the map at this point to be sure.<br />
<br />
There are various trails along the way and plenty of areas <br />
to explore, and can be linked up with other tails like Souerdough to <br />
the south, so good luck and enjoy.  A detailed map of the area or the Falcon Guides mountain biking book would be good to have with you.<br />

Follow the signs to the Georgetown Loop Railroad continue on the bike path to Silver Plume ride up the Argentine R.R. grade past Pavilion Point to Waldorf Road. This is a seven mile climb.

Cross over Gunella Pass road to the upper Silverdale entrance. This section has been ridden quite a bit this year and the track is obvious. From here it's a technical ride to Georgetown on singletrack! Ride across three bridges to the rolling singlrtrack under the power line through Silverdale. The descent to Georgetown is so technical that even walking your bike is difficult! But it's ride able.  When you reach the water tank ride the road down to Georgetown. Beware the gate is sometimes closed . Hang a right to downtown. Find Main Street by the old Public Service Plant. Follow Main Street to Silver Creek Trail. Ride Silver Creek Trail to it's end. Head east on the double track to the Spring Creek four wheel drive sign. Head SE a hundred yards or so pick up the double track that crosses the creek. Follow this down to Dumont. This is an ugly rocky fire road in places!  When you reach the bottom go left and ride past the Animal Shelter. Follow the old road up along the creek to the frontage road.

287566,Colorado Trail: Kenosha Pass To Breckenridge,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/colorado-trail-kenosha-to-breckenridge/,33.0,"Begin at Kenosha Pass trailhead.  Best to get an early start if possible, as this trail took us much longer than we thought it would.  The trail out of Kenosha is fairly easy and definitely scenic.   It has a balance of uphill and downhill, although it does climb more as you get closer to the Georgia Pass area.  This section is very lush and can be pretty treacherous when wet as there are many roots on parts of the trail that made for some slow going.  Weather is unpredictable here too, so plan for bad weather!
<br><br>
The ascent up to Georgia Pass is more or less an easy climb, although the altitude (you are just above treeline) and strong winds may add some excitement for you.  Once at the top, the views on both sides make the climb worthwhile and you will definitely want to bring a camera to record your journey.  It is about 12 miles from Kenosha to the top, and may take about 3 hours depending on your ability.  Technically, this section was not that hard.
<br><br>
The backside of the pass is where things start to get interesting.  Once off the pass, you will immediately hit some great singletrack downhill and the climb up is forgotten.  However, after a few miles you will run into some rocky sections of large boulders in the trail that will probably slow you down quite a bit.  Roots are quite common in this section as well...and can also take their toll.  We ran out of water (we carry 3L Camelbaks) about 6 miles below the pass, so make sure you take a water filter out there!
<br><br>
The CO Trail has been re-routed in one key place, and instead of following the road down for almost the entire length of the trail (as it appears on older maps), it now has a significant climb added in.  If you have an up-to-date map, you will see this climb about 10-12 miles down from Georgia Pass.  Be prepared as it is about 1000' over 1.5 miles and was quite difficult after having ridden in high altitude and having about 22 miles of trail behind us.  It is a long steady climb to be sure, and you will be cursing the CO Trail folks for adding this section in...until you start going down again.  This is some of the best singletrack you will encounter on the CO Trail anywhere from this point back to Denver.  From the top of this ascent, almost all the way to Hwy 9, there are fantastic descents, easy and scenic forest sections, and just a few short climbs thrown in to keep you honest.  Just great riding for the last 10 or so miles.
<br><br>
Once into Breckenridge, it is about a 4 mile ride up the bike path (south) until you get into the business part of town.  You can ride to wherever you arranged to meet your friends.  Have a nice meal, then jump in the car, head back to Kenosha (approx. 1 hour by car) to get your other vehicle, and call it a day.  It took us about 8 hours to do the 32 trail miles...but we had some rain which made things extra slick and slow in a few places.  A good weather day might cut that time somewhat. As with most any trail, you will want to bring a good map with you (we used the Latitude 40, Summit County Trails map).","We had a car parked on both ends of this route.  A nice way to do this is to have a couple of friends (or significant others) drop you off at Kenosha Pass you can ride this path 32 miles down into Breckenridge and meet them.

It is mostly mellow forest riding, a few miles of road, a few miles of uphill climbing, and some fairly fast but unremarkable downhill.  Being in the Fraser area means that there is little true ""single track"" -- most of the trails are reclaimed forest roads that are being used as bike trails.  That means don't count on much roller coaster fun riding.  It is pretty much all steady grade climbs and descents, mostly straight trail without a lot of thrills.  You can ride this loop clockwise or counterclockwise.  Clockwise will present Tipperary as a downhill, which is preferable to riding Spruce Creek down since Spruce Creek is basically a steady grade with lots of loose rock.  Tipperary, in my opinion, is the better ride down.  On the other hand, riding counterclockwise means you can ride down Flume, which is one of the funner rides in the area.  Don't even try to do this ride without a good map or somebody who knows the way; there are too many trails and intersections that can lead you astray.  Note, if you are riding counterclockwise, when you get to the bottom of Flume, you will want to go across the creek (the fork to the left) and pick up the lower section of the Creekside trail to take you back to the road.

The area has some great campgrounds and the Tarryall Creek, which is excellent for tubing and fishing.  Lost Creek has some awesome hiking trails and excellent rock climbing.<br />
<br />
Lizard Rock climbs out of the Spruce CG.  The climb is fairly easy and straightforward with very few technical sections, which are all rideable.  It takes you up to Lizard Rock which offers fabulous 360 degree views.  The return downhill is fast and open. <br />
<br />
Due to its proximity to the Spruce CG PLEASE BE AWARE OF HIKERS AND EQUESTRIANS AT ALL TIMES and yield the trail appropriately.  The trail can get pretty fast if you want it, but on a weekend there'll definitely be families hiking it, so be prepared and be cool.  <br />
<br />
Since this trail is kind of short you can pair it with Brookside-McCurdy to get a decent couple of hours in.<br />

Generally hike up and bike down.  Going up was interesting, as you're on the side of a steep mountain for the first mile or so, and you get the ""I hope I don't screw up, as it's a long tumble down"" feeling.  Going down I didn't even notice the edge.  The terrain is varied and generally technical and is an interesting ride.  Coming down, there are half a dozen places I had to walk, and I generally don't walk down hill.  The total accent is 3200ft, so be prepared to burn your brakes coming down.

There are also east-west trails that split the Pike ""square"" in half, and others that connect this to the northernmost leg of Pikes Peak trail.<br />
Intersections are usually marked with the trail names, but there's no map for reference and some portions seem to dead end at road intersections.  But these trails actually pick up tens of yards across and down the road with no signs to point you in the right direction.<br />
Lots of rollercoaster hills, with the northernmost leg of Pike heading east being the hardest. IMO CCW is easier (steeper descent; more gradual incline) and more fun, than CW.  Sandy and loose in many sections.  The trails are rarely less than about 3' wide, and many times are wider.  Most sections are off limits to horses.  All are off limits to motorized vehicles.

For $36 (in 2017) you can ride the chairlift all day but if you're in training you'll find good climbing singletrack to take you up the almost 800 vertical feet to the summit of the bike park.  Or if you're looking after the kids there are easy trails down low. 

Unlike Steamboat Ski Resort the downhill trails are not restricted to chairlift ticket holders. These downhill trails are good - well designed and feature rich with oodles of jumps, bermed corners, rock gardens, wooden structures and other challenges for skill levels ranging from intermediate to expert.

Cross-country riders should pick up the free map from the friendly people in the big base building where you'll also find rest rooms, an ATM, a grill, and a great bike hire depot with a full range of bikes at reasonable prices.   

My pick of the cross-country trails is Fraser Canyon which starts at the top of the chair-lift and is mainly down-sloping as it goes the long way back to the base with nice views over the Canyon - actually just a deep valley.  It is suitable for intermediate riders.

So what's not so good at Granby Ranch?  Their trail grades seemed a little eccentric to me and tended to understate the level of difficulty.  The soil is silty in places - just in places! - where it tends to soften up.  And finally, thunder storms can stop the chairlift for extended periods - not uncommon in summer afternoons.

At the bottom of Limber Pine, turn left and travel across the dirt road to access the trail.

Once you've reached the top of the last climb there is double track along a high ridge, which offers beautiful glimpses of Pikes Peak.  The trail quickly descends a pretty beat up, rooted, washed out section and drops you into a dirt Cul-de-sac.

Go straight and ride on Ridge Trail Road until you reach the dam.  *There may be some single track along the bank of North Catamount, but the dirt road offers a quick pace and a moment to rest your legs.*  Cross the dam and look for ""Trail"" signs on your left that will lead you back to the banks of the lake.  This is a great section that meanders in and out of coves, much like Rampart Reservoir, but easier.  Eventually the single track drops into another dirt Cul-de-sac.  There are two roads leading out and one single track.  The single track follows the lake, but is less defined.  The less traveled road is also a good option.  If you are beat, you can take the main road back out.  The single track will lead you back to Limber Pines trail, which you would return on.  The two roads entail an uphill climb that intersect with the Catamount road.  Turn left once you reach this road.  Once on the road look for an access point on your right hand side for the upper portion of the Limber Pines trail, which is also part of the Ring the Peak trail.

Since bikes are not allowed on the toll road, this is the only way to ride your bike to the top of Pikes Peak. Be prepared for fast changing weather and much colder conditions on top.

Once you pass through the rock arch, the grade levels out a bit, but it's still a continuous climb. You'll have a couple small flat sections between the top of the incline and Barr Camp. Barr Camp marks the mid-point of the ride in both distance and elevation gain. Up to this point, the trail has been 99% rideable, but beyond Barr Camp the trail gets much more difficult.

Once above treeline, the trail gets even tougher not only because of the lack of oxygen but also because of loose pea gravel and very large boulders.

The trail leaves the edge of the cirque back towards the middle of the east face to the start of the 16 Golden Stairs. The Golden Stairs are 16 pairs of switchbacks (32 switchbacks) that meander through the large boulders to the top. Most of the stairs are not rideable and it's so tight between some of the rocks that it's hard to carry the bike. Near the last switchback, you'll see the cog train at the top - You're almost there! Cross the tracks, get your obligatory summit photo, and grab a bite to eat in the cafe. Now reverse course and don't forget to use that thing you've got under the helmet. The ride down (especially above treeline) is a mental exercise in making good decisions.

287173,Copper Triangle,https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/copper-triangle/,30.0,"This trail is roughly 30 miles with 5-6 of those miles above treeline. The first couple of legs of this ride are on the Colorado Trail (Copper to Camp Hale via Searle Pass and Kokomo Pass), where it's almost all singletrack, while the return is mostly on 4x4 road, double track, and paved bike path.

Start by finding your way into the heart of the Copper Village and look for the chairlift named American Eagle. The start of the trail is just to the right of the lift (before American Flyer) and is a dirt road that you'll see switchback up the hillside. After the first switchback, you'll see a rock painted white with the Colorado Trail symbol painted on it and a singletrack next to it. Continue to follow this trail as it meanders and switchbacks up Copper Mountain. There are many side trails that cut off the CO trail through this section, but the CO trail is clearly marked. This part of the trail has been heavily used by horses, but don't let the leftovers deter you, it'll quickly be over and the real riding will begin.

You'll eventually come out at a stream (Guller Ck) with a crossing and a long open valley. The horse traffic should be over, and you'll continue up the valley to above treeline. You'll top out after a bit of hike-a-bike at Searle Pass (12,035ft, 7mi). 

Before you go beyond this point, make sure the CO weather is on your side. You've still got over 3 miles to Kokomo Pass (all above treeline) and on the return trip Ptarmigan Pass ( at treeline). Neither are good places to be in a thunderstorm.

If it all looks good, continue across the vast alpine tundra to Kokomo Pass (12,011 ft, 10 mi). This is arguably the best tundra riding in all of Colorado (similar to Monarch Crest, but without all the people). 

Once you reach Kokomo Pass, the fun begins. You've got 3,000 vertical feet to drop to reach Camp Hale. The downhill has got just about everything you could think of: rolling singletrack, fast double track, switchbacks, loose technical sections, etc.

You'll reach the forest road at the valley floor. Take a right to contour around the bottom of the mountain through historic Camp Hale (home of the 10th Mountain Division during WWII). At the north end of Camp Hale, you'll see the 4x4 road (Ptarmigan Pass) heading up to the right (east). Continue up this road, for what will seem like an eternity until you top out at Ptarmigan Pass (11,772 ft, 23.4mi).

From the top of Ptarmigan Pass, you should be able to see I-70 and Vail Pass to the NE. Follow the 4x4 road as it drops off the pass for less than a mile to where it reaches a saddle on the ridge. The road will drop off the ridge to the left (west), but you want to take the small trail that drops off the ridge to the right (east). This is Wilder Gulch and it's all downhill from here.

Continue down Wilder Gulch until it reaches I-70. There are some very swampy spots through here, so be aware and stay on the trail! At the end of the valley, jump on the paved bike path and cruise back to your car.",Take I-70 into the mountains and exit towards Copper Mountain.

This trail system is undoubtedly cross-country oriented, but that doesn't mean it's easy. Some of these trails are rather technical, incorporating many natural rocks and features for a very pedally, technical disposition. <br />
That said, all of the singletrack is superbly designed, contouring with the land and passing by some of the most interesting and scenic features.<br />
Thanks to the unique climate surrounding Canon City, this area stays very dry, even during the winter.<br />
Be sure to bring a camera for all of the fantastic views, and a little suspension for the rocks wouldn't hurt, either.",Up County Road 9.
