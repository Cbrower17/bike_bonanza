The downhills can get pretty gnarly as well with lots of rocks and log dropoffs.  We didn't get to ride the entire network because we got caught in a thunderstorm, luckily we hid out in a cave on the Mustang trail until the storm passed.   Pick up a map at the parking lot as there are several trails to explore! ",

Red Rocks trail is totally different from the Dakota ridge....much greener and smoother. It's mostly a single track dirt trail. A couple of climbs, but not bad at all. This is not nearly as technical, and the scenery is amazing. You will be riding through towering red rocks and beautiful shrubbery. This trail loops back up to the parking area. So you have a 6 mile loop with slick rock, desert, sand, red rock, single track, beautiful scenery, and skill levels for everyone.

Located just to the south of Green Mountain, it provides a close-in alternative for riders to get some exercise in the winter months.  I rode it in late December and was practically the only person in the entire park.  The trails are generally singletrack, although a few are shared with horses (with associated issues).  There is one minor hill climb but many ups and downs throughout the park.  There are a variety of trail options and directions, but given the size of the park, it is impossible to get lost here.  Ridden at high speeds and high energy, you can still get a good workout on this system.  Most of the trails are well kept and the ones I hit were very low on the technical scale.  Probably similar to the trail that goes around the western base of Green Mountain.  Nonetheless, it made for a nice change.

Just after the bridge is the Villiage Walk loop, a short 1mi beginner loop that can be ridden in either direction.  If you go straight (counter clockwise) in about .3mi you will come to the Red Rocks trail on the right, at this point you can either continue straight ahead to finish the Villiage Walk loop or head onto the Red Rocks trail.  If you take the Village Walk loop back to the parking lot you can continue on to the Dakota Ridge trail by riding across Hwy 26 and up the hill on the other side.  If you take the Red Rocks trail, at about 1mi you will come to the Morrison Slide trail alternate on the right.  Morrison Slide is an alternate that reconnects with the Red Rocks trail in 1.2mi.  You have a choice to continue straight on the Red Rocks trail and stick with less climbing or turn onto the Morrison Slide trail and go up several switchbacks to the \"tabletop\", the views here are great but there are some very rocky switchbacks on the downhill side awaiting you.  At the bottom of the switchbacks the Morrison Slide trail re-connects with the Red Rocks trail at which point you can turn right and coninue on to the Ampitheatre and Dakota Ridge trail or turn left and take the Red Rocks trail back to the Villiage Walk trail and on to the parking lot.  If you decided to pass the first Morrison Slide cutoff and continue straight on the Red Rocks trail for .8mi you can return by turning right onto the Morrison Slide trail and following it back in the reverse direction.",

This is mostly over when you cross the road the first time.  The trail then becomes a relatively nice climb up the canyon (similar in feel to Apex Park next door).  After another mile and a half, you will cross the road again, but just continue across and keep heading uphill.   This next section is very pleasant and is under the cover of trees for those hot days.  It is all fairly steep though, so dig deep to push on to the summit which is about a mile past the road.   When you hit the picnic table you can look around and take some pictures as you will have a great view all around you.  However, before you go back down...ride uphill onto the pavement and look for a small trail that is on the other side of the road and heads off between the road and a large fence.  I recommend jumping on that singletrack and following it for a mile or so as it is fast, fairly level, and great fun.  When you reach the end you will be at an intersection with Lookout Mtn Rd again, and this is where you can catch the descent into Apex park and loop at the bottom back to the Chimney Gulch parking lot.  However, for this description, we turned around here and did our trail in reverse, making for a long, fast descent back to the car.  <br>If you are feeling a bit lazy, you can catch Lookout Mtn Rd and blaze down the pavement to save time!",

Also, there is no bailout point along the trail. You either complete your ride, or go back the way you came.\r\n\r\nThe most notable feature on the trail is a section called \u201cThe Ledge\u201d, which traverses a cliff face with a rock wall on one side and a 50-foot drop on the other. As impressive as the exposure is, the trail is fully 4 to 5 feet wide at that point.\r\n\r\nAfter riding an easement behind a very expensive neighborhood, the climb up Plymouth Mountain is mostly shaded, and quite challenging due to the elevation gain and the numerous switchbacks.\r\n\r\nThis section is also home to at least one black Bear, hence the name of the trail.\r\n\r\nFrom the Hildebrand Ranch parking lot, to the Deer Creek Park lot, is about 12 miles. You can ride pavement downhill from Deer Creek to Hildebrand to make a loop ride, or do an out and back for more singletrack mileage.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the trail is closed from February 1 to July 31 due to nesting/mating season for raptors on Plymouth Mountain.",

This loop has a good bit of climbing (especially compared to the first 6 miles on gravel road).  You'll probably climb a little over 1000 feet on this loop.   A great workout and a very fun and scenic trail.",

Alternate access to the first section of the Colorado Trail will be from the west leg of the Indian Creek loop. (from comba.org)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis section of the CT is undoubtedly the most travelled section both for hikers and mountain bikers. It is about 17 miles from the Waterton parking lot to the parking lot at South Platte.  The first 6 miles up Waterton Canyon is especially crowded, and is likely to be filled with children and weaving pedestrians.  Once you get to the Strontia dam, the trail begins it's upward journey for the next couple of miles up to the \"sitting bench.\"  If you turn left you will be on the Roxborough Loop, and if you continue on past the bench (downhill) you will be on the Colorado Trail.  Only 460 miles to Durango!<br />\r\n<br><br><br />\r\nThe singletrack is pretty sweet on this part of the trail, although this first descent is almost the only downhill you will do for about the next 8 miles!  You will encounter some pleasant forest covered trail, as well as some very rocky and technical uphill sections that are easier to walk than to ride.  On long distance rides you are better off walking some places rather than exert too much energy. You have to save something for the trip back!  Remember that as you plow into these steep hills...<br />\r\n<br><br><br />\r\nOnce over a couple of these rocky sections, you will head into the open-to-motorcycles section of the trail, and the rocks get bigger and the trail gets even harder.  You WILL be walking parts of the trail here.  Again, this is mostly uphill...although it does eventually level out somewhat.  Overall, the grades are pretty easy on this trail and it is mostly ridable once you pass the motorcycle area.  Then begins a long steady climb with rolling hills and great views as you head west towards South Platte.<br><br><br />\r\nAt about mile 13 you will find yourself on the top of a rocky outcropping looking down on the river to the west.  This is the beginning of the last descent.  This one is MAJOR.  If you want an easy day, turn around here and head back to Waterton.  No one will think any less of you.  However, if you are up for a challenge, you can complete this section of the CO Trail by heading down what is nearly a 4 mile descent straight down.  Great fun as the trail is well maintained, and the switchbacks are all pretty ridable.  Your hands will burn from using the breaks and holding on for dear life as you blaze down this trail and finally emerge at the river.  As you turn around, you will be shocked at how far you dropped!  Congratulations, you have just completed section 1 of the Colorado Trail!<br />\r\n<br><br><br />\r\nIt is best to carry a water filter, as you might find yourself on the edge of your water allowance on the return trip.  This is important as now you are looking at a 4 mile climb to get out of the valley and get back to Waterton!  After a rest, you can begin the ascent and hopefully survive the climb without too much walking (some of the switchbacks are a bit tricky when going uphill).  Note the joy on the faces of those downhillers speeding by you, and remember a happier time when that was you!  Honestly, the grade is not terrible and although long, most of this ascent is not that bad.  If you do OK on Mt. Falcon or Deer Creek, you will probably have no trouble here.  <br />\r\n<br><br><br />\r\nNow, once you knock out that climb, you are looking at a great ride back towards Waterton.  For the first several miles you have rolling singletrack that is a pure joy to coast down.  I would estimate that for about 5 miles the trail is rolling singletrack, until it eventually goes back into the motorcycle area.  Going down is much easier, despite the large rocks in the trail.  You will also be able to go down the steeper hills at the end of this stretch if you don't mind loose, steep, rocky trail.  At the very end, you will have one last ascent that can be a bit of a burner after all you've been through to this point (about 25 miles of trail behind you).  When done, you will be back up to the resting bench...at which point it is all downhill and dirt road back to Waterton parking lot.  Total mileage should be around 34 miles to do the out and back.",

            "description": "The first and last 6 miles of this trail are on the gravel road that goes through Waterton Canyon, meaning your total off-road trail distance will be about 17 miles (29 miles total).  Nonetheless, there is a lot of climbing and some route finding skills required, which means this ride has the potential to be MUCH longer than you anticipate.  If you carry a good map with you, there should be few problems.  If you grab the Trails Illustrated Map #135 for Deckers and Rampart Range, it has a blowup view of this entire trail system on the back and shows the loop almost perfectly.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe first 6 miles will take you up to the dam.  You will continue on up the fire road until it ends and changes into singletrack (beginning the Colorado Trail).  This will continue to climb for about another mile until you reach the bench at the top.  From here you will notice a trail spur on the left just before you reach the bench, heading uphill.  This begins a short, but intense climb to the next intersection which is about \u00ba mile or so from the bench.  At this intersection you will notice the trail going left (back to Waterton) or to the right (uphill) heading onto the Indian Creek Loop.  Begin climbing once again as the trail strives to get to the ridgeline for about the next half mile or so.  You will finally reach a steep, loose section of trail which goes straight up, then to the left.  Once you clear this nasty section, it levels off from there.  This will be the last of the really bad climbs for quite some time.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNow that you are on the ridgeline, the trail does some gentle uphills interspersed with slight descents.  Eventually you will roll off the east side of the hill and a quick, but steep descent puts you at a T intersection.  Note that the left trail is NOT on the trails illustrated map.  If you turn left into Stevens Gulch, this will take you down a fun, fast descent back towards the Roxborough Loop (make sure you make a left when you reach the homestead!).  If you turn right at this T, this will continue you on the journey towards the Indian Creek campground (the mid-way point of this ride).  Now, the trail becomes a fun downhill as it tracks down to the creek bed.  Once you reach that point, you will start to gradually go back up as you follow the creek for another mile or so.  This is a very scenic portion of the ride, and nice and cool in the shade of the forest.  There will be some tiring climbs as you get closer to the campground, but they are mostly just long grinds on easy terrain.  After a final little rock obstacle, you will be in the campground.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFrom here, proceed to the latrine and potable water faucet.  You should see the clearly marked singletrack peeling off to the left, up the hill.  Once you refill your water, head back up the trail and begin another set of climbs.  Note that this section of trail is NOT on the trails illustrated map.  The grade here is pretty gentle, although you will be going uphill until you reach the fire road.  There will be several roads/trails at this intersection, but only one should be marked with the Indian Creek signage (as you come off the singletrack, look straight across and to the left down the hill).  This next section is on a fire road, but it is fast and fun because most of it goes downhill from this point.  You will come to a few odd intersections, but the trail is well marked the whole way.  At one Y intersection there was some deliberation on our route because the sign has an arrow which points between the two roads\u00d6but at this point you want to go up to the left.  The left route was also well used in comparison to the right fork.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs you get closer to the Roxborough State Park, beware of the huge \u00ecspeed bumps\u00ee someone has put in all along the trail.  These really are big jumps, but they are at odd intervals and around corners so they may take you by surprise if you aren\u00edt paying attention.  Because of their sharp angles, they are extremely dangerous to hit at even medium speed.  One guy in the group riding ahead of us broke his collarbone because he took these just slightly too fast. The fire road eventually begins to return to singletrack, especially once you reach the power lines.  At this point, you will get some incredible singletrack, blasting you through the forest as you cheer in delight.  You absolutely cannot miss the signage once you enter the State Park, but the singletrack generally continues along the creek bed here.  Your fun will end as you reach another tough climb out of the canyon (luckily it is rather short).  Your journey will go downhill again from here, and at one point you will come to an incredible meadow with just a ribbon of singletrack laid out before you.  If you can force yourself to stop, this is a great place for a snapshot!<br><br>\r\n\r\nOnce you reach the creek crossing, you will begin one more little set of climbs as you get ready to go back down into Waterton Canyon.  Once you start the downhill again, it doesn\u00edt let up until you are back down at the Waterton Canyon gravel road.  This section of trail is like a loose chute with lots of dust and loose rocks\u00d6but it can be a lot of fun as well.  There will be one intersection you pass with a trail going off to your left as you get back on the Roxborough Loop, but just continue straight downhill rather than making a left.  The signs all point you towards Waterton Canyon from here.  Once we popped out, we all agreed that despite the amount of climbing we suffered through, the payoff was well worth the effort.  I\u00edm not sure if there is any merit in doing the loop in the reverse direction, although it is worth mentioning that I can\u00edt recall passing anyone in all those miles going the opposite direction.  Also note this is an equestrian loop as well, so best practice is to dismount when you see horses, pull off the trail and be friendly to them.  ",

            "description": "The initial climb out of the parking lot is by far the hardest part of this section of the Colorado Trail.  Within the past several years, a re-routed portion of trail was created and if you carry a map with you, it might show the trail going northwest, instead of the correct southwest.  However, the trail is very well marked and easy to follow.  Once the initial mile or so of climbing on pea gravel is out of the way, the degree of steepness does ease up somewhat, although this trail continues gradually upward for many more miles.  While we were prepared to do some climbing, this section of the CT really kept it coming.<br><br>\r\nLuckily, the grade is never too steep so that you should be able to grind up most of this trail.  The first 1/3 of this trail is burned out from a recent forest fire, and is quite interesting to ride through.  The second 1/3 of the trail is normal forest, while the last 1/3 is back in the burn zone (you will cross a fire road at one point, and although the trail has no markers on the other side, you DO want to cross the road and continue on the singletrack).  The last 1/3 is definitely more level, although you will encounter a variety of ups and downs and at times, some very fast singletrack!  The final mile from Hwy 126 to the Little Scraggy Trailhead (where many park for rides into Buffalo Creek area) is nice and flat doubletrack.<br><br>\r\nThe trip back from Little Scraggy is where this section of trail really shines.  On the return, your first 1/3 is fun ups and downs, the middle 1/3 has one short uphill section which will be the last of the climbing for the day...and the last 1/3 is pure downhill for what seems like forever!  This is payback for all the climbing you had to do on the way in... None of this trail is particularly technical, and most of it is well traveled and well worn.  Naturally you can get some pretty good speed going since your visibility in the burn zone is fairly distant. <br><br>\r\nYou will need to bring as much water as you can, especially in the summer months, as there are no water sources on this section of trail.  If all goes wrong, you can bail out on Hwy 126 and head down the hill back to the \"town\" of Buffalo Creek (and take the gravel road back to your car).  If you have a water filter, you can water up at that point.  However, all effort should be made to ride this trail in both directions, as the return back down the hill is really worthwhile.  Set aside 3-4 hours to do the entire route.  More if you like to stop, enjoy the scenery, etc.",
            "directions": "The trailhead is at a place called South Platte, although this is really just a parking area rather than a village.  The easiest way to get there is probably Hwy 285 to Pine Junction, then Hwy 126 to Buffalo Creek, then make a left down the gravel road (following the river) and head east/se for about 10 miles.  The trailhead is well marked, and there is a pedestrian bridge and outhouse at the trailhead.",

Valmont offers something for almost every type of mountain biker, and the way the park is designed it allows those with no skills and those with tons to both have fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith about 4 miles of flowy cross country trails ringing the park and littered with practice features, it is a great place to go for an in-town mountain bike ride or to introduce newbies to the sport. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the main feature is the jump lines. Specifically, Valmont has 2 different pump tracks, a dirt jump area with 5 different lines (XS, S, M, L, XL) a flowy rhythmic slopestyle area with 4 different main lines (S, M, L, XL) and an untold number of combinations between those lines, as well as a dual slalom race course. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nValmont is a great place to bring the family for a fun day at a bike-themed park. There is a \u201ctot track\u201d that is an easy spot for tots to push their bikes around, there\u2019s also picnic tables and a snack machine nearby as well as playground equipment for when the tots get bored of the bikes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is plenty at Valmont to keep you entertained for the day\u2014and for many days to come! Working on your skills on the various jumps and technical features could become a life-long journey as you work towards perfection. ",

You can do it all without repeating yourself much. The full meal deal will have you hitting about 3K verts at altitude, so it's more than just a ride in the park. This is a great exercise/training ride, with some great scenery. But it's really a lot like doing nearby Buffalo Creek with all the climbing but not all the fun. Park is hugely busy on weekends, I recommend doing the Marmot Passage trail clockwise for a more doable climb followed by hitting the best techy bits in the park on the descent. I also recommend doing the Borderline/Mason Creek Trail combo clockwise. The climb up borderline is quite heinous, but this is the only way to bet the longest fast and flowy downhill in the park. Of course, if you prefer a long, gradual climb with a shorter, steeper descent, reverse this portion.\" -skibum",

It's a relatively easy 1,300 foot climb, and because of that, and the exposure, it's a good early season trail.

The trail system is basically laid out with a figure 8 around the top of the mountain/ridge, and an out-and-back trail running up to it from the north and one from the south. The trailhead location given here, and one of the most popular rides, is to ride from the southern trailhead, up the 2.5-mile trail, around some of the trails on top, and back down. The out-and-back trail coming in from the north is 5.5 miles one-way, so riding from the northern trailhead would make for a longer ride\u2026 and riding absolutely everything would make for a grueling experience with tons of climbing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut all of that climbing is worth it, though! The trails here sport that characteristic Front Range rockiness, with plenty of chunk to pedal through on the climb up and around the upper trails. However, there are a few buff sections of trail thrown in at random, and none of the rocks are seriously big. It is all very easy to pedal through, and by Front Range standards is probably only intermediate in difficulty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce at the top, be sure to take in the amazing views of the Front Range! Then get ready to descend. The descent back down is what it\u2019s all about, and despite all of the rocks these trails sport some serious flow! All of the undulations, grade reversals, and swooping turns are just perfect, allowing you to carry some serious speed. But since both of the trails climbing to the top are ridden out-and-back, be sure to watch for oncoming traffic and to always ride in control. This trail is very popular, so keep your eyes peeled and don\u2019t get too crazy\u2026 but have fun, because the bomb back down is awesome!",

On your bike get back on the street you drove into town on head S.W. to the 4-way intersection continue straight through the intersection cross over Clear Creek follow the street 2 or 3 blocks to Main St. a T-intersection turn left ride a short distance to a stop sign continue straight Main St turns into Saxton Mountain Road you will see the sign on the right after about another 1/4 mile you will see a sign indicating Silver Creek Trail 1/10 mile. There is no trailhead sign so look for the trail on the left at the last house just as the road starts to turn to the right. The trail takes off at the bottom of what looks like a driveway I'ts actually a road. You can see the trail if you look in the direction of the lake. The trail is about 5 miles long and ends at a 4x4 road. From here return as you came or you can connect with Dumont or Lawson by following 4x4 roads down to the frontage road and then back to Georgetown. There is also a trailhead for Silver Creek Trail just below Georgetown on the frontage road. Look for it just after you cross over Clear Creek on the right just past the driveway. ",

It can also be divided into two shorter loops. Pavilion Point/Silverdale or Silver Creek Empire Pass. The route best ridden counterclockwise.This technical ride takes you through Georgetown's surrounding  old mining camps and towns many of which have been long abandoned. You ride on old wagon roads, mule trails and railroad grades that barley remain on the mountainside! Many of the old pack walls have fallen or are ready to fall leaving only a narrow trail to ride on. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow the signs to the Georgetown Loop Railroad continue on the bike path to Silver Plume ride up the Argentine R.R. grade past Pavilion Point to Waldorf Road. This is a seven mile climb. Left on Waldorf Road down to Gunella Pass Road. The ride down is fast rocky and kind of technical. There is a singletrack on the SE  side of the road that takes you to the bottom of the switchback. Cross over Gunella Pass road to the upper Silverdale entrance. This section has been ridden quite a bit this year and the track is obvious. From here it's a technical ride to Georgetown on singletrack! Ride across three bridges to the rolling singlrtrack under the power line through Silverdale. The descent to Georgetown is so technical that even walking your bike is difficult! But it's ride able.  When you reach the water tank ride the road down to Georgetown. Beware the gate is sometimes closed . Hang a right to downtown. Find Main Street by the old Public Service Plant. Follow Main Street to Silver Creek Trail. Ride Silver Creek Trail to it's end. Head east on the double track to the Spring Creek four wheel drive sign. Head SE a hundred yards or so pick up the double track that crosses the creek. Follow this down to Dumont. This is an ugly rocky fire road in places!  When you reach the bottom go left and ride past the Animal Shelter. Follow the old road up along the creek to the frontage road. Take the frontage road to Empire Junction. Follow the gas line across the meadow at the base of Douglas Mountain to Minton Park in Empire. If you can't find it take US 40 to Empire left on Main to the park. Continue on Main ( Bard Creek) to Empire Pass Back to Georgetown.<br />\r\nI know it's kind of complicated but this is turning out to be a great ride. Route finding is moderate. If you copy and print the directions you should be able to find your way",

The trail will now descend along the edge of a ponderosa forest with nice views of the Rampart Range to the south and west.  The trail will once again connect back with the Greenland trail which  can be followed back South to the trailhead.   This trail can also be ridden as a continuation of the northern end of the New Santa Fe trail.",

            "description": "Begin at Kenosha Pass trailhead.  Best to get an early start if possible, as this trail took us much longer than we thought it would.  The trail out of Kenosha is fairly easy and definitely scenic.   It has a balance of uphill and downhill, although it does climb more as you get closer to the Georgia Pass area.  This section is very lush and can be pretty treacherous when wet as there are many roots on parts of the trail that made for some slow going.  Weather is unpredictable here too, so plan for bad weather!\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe ascent up to Georgia Pass is more or less an easy climb, although the altitude (you are just above treeline) and strong winds may add some excitement for you.  Once at the top, the views on both sides make the climb worthwhile and you will definitely want to bring a camera to record your journey.  It is about 12 miles from Kenosha to the top, and may take about 3 hours depending on your ability.  Technically, this section was not that hard.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe backside of the pass is where things start to get interesting.  Once off the pass, you will immediately hit some great singletrack downhill and the climb up is forgotten.  However, after a few miles you will run into some rocky sections of large boulders in the trail that will probably slow you down quite a bit.  Roots are quite common in this section as well...and can also take their toll.  We ran out of water (we carry 3L Camelbaks) about 6 miles below the pass, so make sure you take a water filter out there!\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe CO Trail has been re-routed in one key place, and instead of following the road down for almost the entire length of the trail (as it appears on older maps), it now has a significant climb added in.  If you have an up-to-date map, you will see this climb about 10-12 miles down from Georgia Pass.  Be prepared as it is about 1000' over 1.5 miles and was quite difficult after having ridden in high altitude and having about 22 miles of trail behind us.  It is a long steady climb to be sure, and you will be cursing the CO Trail folks for adding this section in...until you start going down again.  This is some of the best singletrack you will encounter on the CO Trail anywhere from this point back to Denver.  From the top of this ascent, almost all the way to Hwy 9, there are fantastic descents, easy and scenic forest sections, and just a few short climbs thrown in to keep you honest.  Just great riding for the last 10 or so miles.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOnce into Breckenridge, it is about a 4 mile ride up the bike path (south) until you get into the business part of town.  You can ride to wherever you arranged to meet your friends.  Have a nice meal, then jump in the car, head back to Kenosha (approx. 1 hour by car) to get your other vehicle, and call it a day.  It took us about 8 hours to do the 32 trail miles...but we had some rain which made things extra slick and slow in a few places.  A good weather day might cut that time somewhat. As with most any trail, you will want to bring a good map with you (we used the Latitude 40, Summit County Trails map).",

Either direction is fun on the wilds trail, but on the hunters if you go left, the rocks angle against you. There is very little shade on this trail.",

            "description": "This loop combines various sections of trail into a ride that can be done in under a few hours.  It is mostly mellow forest riding, a few miles of road, a few miles of uphill climbing, and some fairly fast but unremarkable downhill.  Being in the Fraser area means that there is little true \"single track\" -- most of the trails are reclaimed forest roads that are being used as bike trails.  That means don't count on much roller coaster fun riding.  It is pretty much all steady grade climbs and descents, mostly straight trail without a lot of thrills.  You can ride this loop clockwise or counterclockwise.  Clockwise will present Tipperary as a downhill, which is preferable to riding Spruce Creek down since Spruce Creek is basically a steady grade with lots of loose rock.  Tipperary, in my opinion, is the better ride down.  On the other hand, riding counterclockwise means you can ride down Flume, which is one of the funner rides in the area.  Don't even try to do this ride without a good map or somebody who knows the way; there are too many trails and intersections that can lead you astray.  Note, if you are riding counterclockwise, when you get to the bottom of Flume, you will want to go across the creek (the fork to the left) and pick up the lower section of the Creekside trail to take you back to the road.  If you ride it clockwise you can ride up Creekside instead of Flume (they both parallel the creek) and not slowdown the downhill riders on Flume.",

Due to the short length before hitting the wilderness boundary, I don't recommend making a trip just for this ride.  I had some leg left after riding from Kenosha Pass south to the wilderness boundary and back, so I deciced to hit this on the way back home--I'm glad I did.

After going about .2 miles the trail will branch to your left (south) and head up a loose 4x4 road for a hundred yards.  The trail then turns into (for me) a hike 'n bike trail.  Generally hike up and bike down.  Going up was interesting, as you're on the side of a steep mountain for the first mile or so, and you get the \"I hope I don't screw up, as it's a long tumble down\" feeling.  Going down I didn't even notice the edge.  The terrain is varied and generally technical and is an interesting ride.  Coming down, there are half a dozen places I had to walk, and I generally don't walk down hill.  The total accent is 3200ft, so be prepared to burn your brakes coming down.  I'd recommend bringing hiking shoes in addition to your cleats, and switching out at the top.  The top of the summit is marked by a large cairn (either that or I couldn't find the trail again).",

It's a series of rectangular trails that also connects to the Black Forest Regional Park on the south boundary.  The parking area is near the NE corner and is near the high point for the trails, so it's mostly downhill at first with going uphill to get back.  The outer \"square\" loop, Pikes Peak Trail, runs along the perimeter and is a 4.6 mile loop.  There are also east-west trails that split the Pike \"square\" in half, and others that connect this to the northernmost leg of Pikes Peak trail.<br />\r\nIntersections are usually marked with the trail names, but there's no map for reference and some portions seem to dead end at road intersections.  But these trails actually pick up tens of yards across and down the road with no signs to point you in the right direction.<br />\r\nLots of rollercoaster hills, with the northernmost leg of Pike heading east being the hardest. IMO CCW is easier (steeper descent; more gradual incline) and more fun, than CW.  Sandy and loose in many sections.  The trails are rarely less than about 3' wide, and many times are wider.  Most sections are off limits to horses.  All are off limits to motorized vehicles.  I can ride for an hour and not come across another biker or a hiker.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExcellent views of Pikes Peak.  90% is in trees.  Some meadows and next to ponds.  Some trails also come within about 20 yards or so of the homes.   Elk and mule deer can be seen on occasion.  Western bluebirds, magpie, nuthatches, and flickers are common.<br />\r\nThe connection on the southernmost leg of Pike Peak trail connects with the Black Forest Regional Park trails, but the intersections aren't marked.",

            "description": "Granby Ranch has a full range of both lift serviced downhill trails and cross-country trails.\r\n\r\nFor $36 (in 2017) you can ride the chairlift all day but if you're in training you'll find good climbing singletrack to take you up the almost 800 vertical feet to the summit of the bike park.  Or if you're looking after the kids there are easy trails down low. \r\n\r\nUnlike Steamboat Ski Resort the downhill trails are not restricted to chairlift ticket holders. These downhill trails are good - well designed and feature rich with oodles of jumps, bermed corners, rock gardens, wooden structures and other challenges for skill levels ranging from intermediate to expert.\r\n\r\nCross-country riders should pick up the free map from the friendly people in the big base building where you'll also find rest rooms, an ATM, a grill, and a great bike hire depot with a full range of bikes at reasonable prices.   \r\n\r\nMy pick of the cross-country trails is Fraser Canyon which starts at the top of the chair-lift and is mainly down-sloping as it goes the long way back to the base with nice views over the Canyon - actually just a deep valley.  It is suitable for intermediate riders.\r\n\r\nSo what's not so good at Granby Ranch?  Their trail grades seemed a little eccentric to me and tended to understate the level of difficulty.  The soil is silty in places - just in places! - where it tends to soften up.  And finally, thunder storms can stop the chairlift for extended periods - not uncommon in summer afternoons.\r\n\r\nThere's more useful information on the park website which is here  http://www.granbyranch.com/bike-granby-ranch/bike.html\r\n\r\nThis description updated in July 2017 by Jim Cummings",

Some narrow singletrack with a few opportunities to session rocks can be found on the northeast end of the area at the top of the bluff.  Look for a singletrack veering off to the left (when riding the loop clockwise) away from the man route and down onto the rimrock.

            "description": "This loop is actually several trails which all connect to each other and form the loop. Start out riding up Keystone Gulch. You will climb gradually on this fairly well maintained dirt road for about 4.5 miles. Just after the road veers left, after the third chairlift, look for a road taking off to the right near a large maintenance building. There is a sign here but the day I rode this it was wrapped in plastic and leaning against a tree. At about 5 miles and crossing two ski runs, take the road to the right. Look for a round sign with a blue arrow. There are also bright red signs with bicycle symbol on them marking the trail. Many of these signs however are in disrepair so don't rely on them, but if you do see one you will know you are on the right trail. At this point the trail goes down through a meadow and accross a very small stream. After you cross the stream begin the climb up the westridge to the Colorado Trail. After about three miles the trail intersects the Colorado Trail. At this point you should see the markers (a triangle symbol) identifying the Colorado Trail. Take the sharp right here. Meander across the westridge for a few miles and stay left at the next fork (appx. 8 mi.) If you go right here you will go back down to Keystone gulch. From here the Colorado Trail begins it's long and fast descent toward Breckenridge. After a couple miles descending, the Colorado Trail will make a VERY sharp turn to the left and Red's trail will be the straight option. I believe there is a post at this intersection. Go straight onto Red's Trail and follow the narrow singletrack along a steep hillside and eventually back into the forest. After a few more miles this trail will terminate with a choice of dirt road to the left or more singletrack to the right. Take the single track to the right which is Keystone Ranch Trail. Follow this trail for a few miles. The golf course will be on your left. Cross a few roads and this trail will turn into the Aqueduct trail. Follow the aquaduct trail around the mountain and back to Keystone gulch. Once you come out on the road turn left back to your car.",

The best place to start is in Glenn Have.  The(technical, steep) climb with snaky switchbacks You will come to a crossroads that will take you west to Glen Haven down a wicked-fast bobsled run of rocks and slabs, thru a usually elk-laden Piper Meadows. It's all downhill from here. Or you can continue up for toward the summit trail. The actual summit trail is not really recommended for bikes. It's just not that fun. Steep, loose. More erosion that it's worth. Keep on rocking past the summit and you'll fly through singletrack meadows and glades and sweeping views of the Big Thompson Canyon. Be warned: continuing on this path will present you with one of two options. 1. Continue to the easternmost trailhead nearest Drake.  For wimpy bikers this will mean extensive Hike-a-biking down eroded sections and rock stairs (not the fun kind), and an up-hill road ride back to the car.  This trail received a LOT of damage from the floods and used to be 100% downhill ridable by the badass, now even the bad ass are walking a fair amount of the downhill. 2.

Soon you're in forest - Lodge Pole pines I think - and the climbing becomes more gentle.  After about 6 miles of very pleasant riding along the Colorado Trail take the Red Trail fork. You won't miss the sign - all the signs on this loop are good. Red Trail sidles round a hill above Soda Creek then slopes down through the pine trees of Roosevelt National Forest to Keystone Ranch (a reception center for weddings etc.).  Swing sharp left and ride past the ranch house (normally unoccupied) and climb up through the forest on Hay Trail.  It's climbs about 300 feet till it meets the Blair Witch Trail which meanders up through the forest for another mile and a half till it meets the Colorado Trail to complete the loop.  From there it's two and a half miles and a net descent of about 600 feet back to Revette Drive. \r\n\r\nThis loop samples the Colorado Trail and three other similar back country trails ranging in altitude from 9200 to 10,100 feet. There are panoramic views over to the mountains to the west of Breckenridge. You will feel the serenity of the back-country and the satisfaction of a good undulating 14 mile ride.

Turn right just after Robert's Cabin (you'll see it) to stay on Boreas Pass Road.  After a few mroe miles, look for the sign to Selkirk Campground and follow the dirt road back to the valley floor.  At the bottom, follow 801 past the entrance to Selkirk CG for a couple more miles and look for a fairly inconspicuous forest service sign marking the trail on your left.  Beware, the Trails Illustrated map shows the trail ass 653, but the FS marker says 698, so don't get confused.  There's also a marker and an old doubletrack on your right.  If you get to a fork in the road, you've gone about 0.3 mi too far.  After turning left on to the trail, get ready for some high quality singletrack through a very unspoiled forest.  During the first leg, the trail has worn a groove in the countryside and you can really crank on the bermed turns.  A few more miles and you'll cross county road 50 amid some private property.  Just cross the road and continue on the singletrack.  There's some killer views in this valley followed by a tough, but brief climb.  The trail then becomes soft pine-needle bed, then has a rocky section that will force most off their bikes once or twice, then a rooty descent back to a doubletrack.  Less than a quarter mile into the DT, look for the ST veering off to the right again--don't miss this as this is some particularly sweet singletrack.  About a half mile later, the trail will dump you onto a dirt road--take a right and cruise back into Como.  The dirt road climb has great views, beautiful aspens and fragrant wildflowers, but if you object to riding the road for 9 miles, the ST is doable as an out and back.",

PLEASE NOTE: The gate is closed from October 1st until May 1st, which leaves you with the Elder Fehn Trail (Also good) to ride.  Once through the gate travel south towards the Peak.  This short down hill section is named the Limber Pine Trail.  At the bottom of Limber Pine, turn left and travel across the dirt road to access the trail.  The trail weaves through a wetlands area for a couple hundred yards and then leads into the forest along the banks of North Catamount.  Through this section there are a couple good climbs that lead you away from the reservoir.  Once you've reached the top of the last climb there is double track along a high ridge, which offers beautiful glimpses of Pikes Peak.  The trail quickly descends a pretty beat up, rooted, washed out section and drops you into a dirt Cul-de-sac.  A short distance away there is an intersection, which leads down to both South and North Catamount Reservoirs.  Go straight and ride on Ridge Trail Road until you reach the dam.  *There may be some single track along the bank of North Catamount, but the dirt road offers a quick pace and a moment to rest your legs.*  Cross the dam and look for \"Trail\" signs on your left that will lead you back to the banks of the lake.  This is a great section that meanders in and out of coves, much like Rampart Reservoir, but easier.  Eventually the single track drops into another dirt Cul-de-sac.  There are two roads leading out and one single track.  The single track follows the lake, but is less defined.  The less traveled road is also a good option.  If you are beat, you can take the main road back out.  The single track will lead you back to Limber Pines trail, which you would return on.  The two roads entail an uphill climb that intersect with the Catamount road.  Turn left once you reach this road.  Once on the road look for an access point on your right hand side for the upper portion of the Limber Pines trail, which is also part of the Ring the Peak trail.  This short portion of single track will take you back to the gate and back to the parking lot.  If for some reason you miss the access point, you will eventually come back down to the reservoir where you would take the Limber Pine trail back up the way you came down.  Please Note:  I labeled this trail as single track because a large portion is.  However, a quarter of the trail is on dirt roads.",

The altitude drop is about 400 feet.  It's not steep so it's not chewed up with braking bumps. It features swooping berms and some little jumps.  The biggest berm is a beaut - it's built into the gangue from the historic Naperville Tunnel Mine!  \r\n\r\nProbably the best way to get to it is from the Upper Flume Trail.  That takes you to the bottom but you can ride up, turn around and ride back down.",

Howard can be accessed from the parking lot on the Mill Creek Link Trial, and climbs about 1000 feet to the back Arthur's Rock, where it intersects with the hiking trail to the summit. The trail can be ridden as an out and back, or as a loop with other trails. I prefer to climb the Timber Trail and ride down Howard because there's too much hike-a-bike on the way up Howard, so I'll describe it in that direction.<br />\r\nThe upper part of the trail is very narrow and rolls up and down thru a dense forest -> fun. As the trail turns downward it begins throwing big technical rock obstacles at you, including group of drops with lot of off-angle complications. They are virtually all rideable, but there are lots of endo opportunities with fairly high consequences. There is a section of swoopy flow, and then the trail throws in a steep section with lots of log drops -> fun on the way down but not on the way up. The bottom section is medium speed switchbacks, with enough rocks to keep it interesting.<br />\r\nThe trail mixes in very tight switchbacks throughout the ride. You won't be able to ride them all without some advances techniques.",

The trail throws a series of switchbacks at you which are loose enough to carry some speed. But, as you gain some confidence, the trail challenges you with some oddly angled rock gardens. The rock gardens pop up when your line of sight is limited, and will surprise folks who don't know what to expect. I really enjoy the challenge of riding this trail fast.",

Timber can be ridden as an out and back (8.8 miles), or as a loop with other trails. <br />\r\nThe lower portion of the trail is a fairly smooth and gradual climb by way of a series of switchbacks across scrub and grass covered hills. This section is an intermediate level trail with only a few technical obstacles to clear. There are nice views of Horsetooth Reservoir at every turn. The lower section ends at the intersection with Kimmons Trail. Many riders climb Timber and descend on Kimmons. <br />\r\nBeyond this intersection, Timber Trail really steps up the difficulty level. After a short rolling section of technical riding, the trail heads into the forest. Here, the climb gets much steeper and the switchbacks become extremely tight and technical. Between the switchbacks, there are enough technical challenges to keep any rider busy. All but the superhuman should expect to stop to rest frequently on this climb. Near the top, the trail intersects with the Westridge Trail, where it turns into a dirt road for the last mile to the Arthur's Rock Trail.<br />\r\nThe descent is fun and challenging.

You will see No Trespassing signs, but if you've turned in your waiver at the Cave, you're good to go.  The road has long been shut down and can now be hiked or biked free of automobiles.  The canyon is so narrow in places, you won't believe it was once an auto route!  Keep following the road.  When it switchbacks left, go straight on to the singlegrack.  It's about 3 miles until the trail exits up on Rampart Range Road.  The grade is tough in places and much of the trail is jagged, jumbled rocks that will cause numerous dismounts.  As a climb, it's positively brutal. Even downhill, this will cause a number of hike-a-bikes.   If you don't want to do the out-and-back climb, you can access the trail from above two ways.  One way is to ride up the Rampart Range Road and look for the singletrack on the left near the old shooting range.  Get the Pikes Peak Atlas map by Robert Ormes and Robert Houdek for the approximate location of the trail.  This map also shows where you can drop into Williams about halfway in from the Waldo Canyon loop.  The canyon is spectacular and the adventurous will find this an attractive outing despite the difficulties involved.  It's a real backcountry adventure starting right on the edge of the city.",

Since bikes are not allowed on the toll road, this is the only way to ride your bike to the top of Pikes Peak. Be prepared for fast changing weather and much colder conditions on top. The trail starts out with a few stairs and then enters a section of switchbacks called the incline. The incline climbs at an average grade of 11% for a couple of miles with it almost all being rideable. Once you pass through the rock arch, the grade levels out a bit, but it's still a continuous climb. You'll have a couple small flat sections between the top of the incline and Barr Camp. Barr Camp marks the mid-point of the ride in both distance and elevation gain. Up to this point, the trail has been 99% rideable, but beyond Barr Camp the trail gets much more difficult. Continue climbing up more switchbacks until you reach the bottom of the large cirque/treeline. To the left is a small green A-frame that can make a handy shelter in adverse weather conditions. a**s the weather before continuing on above the A-frame because there is no shelter from here to the top (still over 2,000 vertical feet above you). Once above treeline, the trail gets even tougher not only because of the lack of oxygen but also because of loose pea gravel and very large boulders. The trail switchbacks up and across the east face to the edge of the large chasm (~13,100 ft). You've still got another 1,000 vertical feet to go. The trail leaves the edge of the cirque back towards the middle of the east face to the start of the 16 Golden Stairs. The Golden Stairs are 16 pairs of switchbacks (32 switchbacks) that meander through the large boulders to the top. Most of the stairs are not rideable and it's so tight between some of the rocks that it's hard to carry the bike. Near the last switchback, you'll see the cog train at the top - You're almost there! Cross the tracks, get your obligatory summit photo, and grab a bite to eat in the cafe. Now reverse course and don't forget to use that thing you've got under the helmet. The ride down (especially above treeline) is a mental exercise in making good decisions. There is quite a bit rideable, but it takes good judgment to know when it's best to get off the bike rather than take a chance trying a technical section where you can't afford to make a mistake (You'll see what I mean when you get there). Once you're back to Barr Camp, take a breather and prepare for a screaming downhill back to your car. The forest service estimates that a round trip hiking will take approximately 16 hrs, but on a bike cut that in half (depending of physical condition and acclimatization), while the record for a round trip (by a trail runner) is a little over 3 hours!",

The views are GREAT, take a break and enjoy this part of the trail!

Stay right riding under the quad chair there are spur roads on the right stay on the main road heading up.It gets a bit confusing  with all the spur roads that connect with lift towers but the general direction is up and main road goes through the ski area. Twards the top of the ski area stay right and pass Peak 9 Restaraunt at the top of Beaver Run Super Chair just below timberline. As you leave the ski area boundry you can faintly see the switchbacks of the Wheeler Trail going up to the saddle Between Peaks 8 and 9 on your right. Climb some more switchbacks above timberline until you reach Wheeler Trail marked with a sign and rock carrin. Turn right  and follow Wheeler Trail across the tundra taking time to enjoy the incrediable vistas. The switchbacks loom in front of you. Continue on climbing the switchbacks above the scree field. Hope you're not afraid or heights like I am. Just keep your eyes on the trail and take small sure steps to keep from slidding on the small rocks.[my shoes had no tread!!!] Once on top 12400 ft. you can see all the way down to I-70 and Copper Village.There are great views of the Gore Range  and Ten Mile Creek all the way up to the Climax Mine. From here you have a seriously technical and steep downhill that has washed out alot in the last year. After a few nice rock drops that are like stairs the trail smooths out a bit and you can relax and fly the rest of the way down to Ten Mile Creek.

Follow the trail through the marsh (crossing Beaver Creek) and head north on the other side of the marsh until you hit a doubletrack road.  Go right on the road which will dead end and look for the singletrack beyond the dead end.  This will take you into another drainage where you will follow 747 up to another road heading north.  Look for a fork marked 669.2b sign that says \"to 748\" and follow it to the right. The Trails illustrated map shows this as singletrack but it remains doubletrack for a couple miles.  Be on the lookout for a narrow singletrack to the right signed as trail 748.  Follow trai 748 down to Crooked Creek road (not marked, bu you'll know when you hit the doubletrack).

            "description": "This trail is roughly 30 miles with 5-6 of those miles above treeline. The first couple of legs of this ride are on the Colorado Trail (Copper to Camp Hale via Searle Pass and Kokomo Pass), where it's almost all singletrack, while the return is mostly on 4x4 road, double track, and paved bike path.\r\n\r\nStart by finding your way into the heart of the Copper Village and look for the chairlift named American Eagle. The start of the trail is just to the right of the lift (before American Flyer) and is a dirt road that you'll see switchback up the hillside. After the first switchback, you'll see a rock painted white with the Colorado Trail symbol painted on it and a singletrack next to it. Continue to follow this trail as it meanders and switchbacks up Copper Mountain. There are many side trails that cut off the CO trail through this section, but the CO trail is clearly marked. This part of the trail has been heavily used by horses, but don't let the leftovers deter you, it'll quickly be over and the real riding will begin.\r\n\r\nYou'll eventually come out at a stream (Guller Ck) with a crossing and a long open valley. The horse traffic should be over, and you'll continue up the valley to above treeline. You'll top out after a bit of hike-a-bike at Searle Pass (12,035ft, 7mi). \r\n\r\nBefore you go beyond this point, make sure the CO weather is on your side. You've still got over 3 miles to Kokomo Pass (all above treeline) and on the return trip Ptarmigan Pass ( at treeline). Neither are good places to be in a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nIf it all looks good, continue across the vast alpine tundra to Kokomo Pass (12,011 ft, 10 mi). This is arguably the best tundra riding in all of Colorado (similar to Monarch Crest, but without all the people). \r\n\r\nOnce you reach Kokomo Pass, the fun begins. You've got 3,000 vertical feet to drop to reach Camp Hale. The downhill has got just about everything you could think of: rolling singletrack, fast double track, switchbacks, loose technical sections, etc.\r\n\r\nYou'll reach the forest road at the valley floor. Take a right to contour around the bottom of the mountain through historic Camp Hale (home of the 10th Mountain Division during WWII). At the north end of Camp Hale, you'll see the 4x4 road (Ptarmigan Pass) heading up to the right (east). Continue up this road, for what will seem like an eternity until you top out at Ptarmigan Pass (11,772 ft, 23.4mi).\r\n\r\nFrom the top of Ptarmigan Pass, you should be able to see I-70 and Vail Pass to the NE. Follow the 4x4 road as it drops off the pass for less than a mile to where it reaches a saddle on the ridge. The road will drop off the ridge to the left (west), but you want to take the small trail that drops off the ridge to the right (east). This is Wilder Gulch and it's all downhill from here.\r\n\r\nContinue down Wilder Gulch until it reaches I-70. There are some very swampy spots through here, so be aware and stay on the trail! At the end of the valley, jump on the paved bike path and cruise back to your car.",

If you make it to the hard left hand turn on the dirt road you have gone too far.  As you head up the trail take the first possible hard right.  You will follow this trail up through pine trees on some great single track that includes some great views, a series of switchbacks, and minor rock and root obstacles to go around or over (it really isn't too technical going up - although it is fairly narrow).  Eventually, (after about 1.4 miles of nearly all up) you will come to a T intersection.  Take a right for this description (if you go left you can link into Trail 666 - see Bear Creek Loop description).  Once you take the right your climb is almost over.  Continue on this trail to the top of the mountain for some really nice views.  Once the trail starts to drop, it goes fairly fast.  Watch out for loose gravel due to the moto bikes that are allowed on this part of the trail (unlike the previous section).  Once you hit the dirt road (High Drive) you take a right and ride the mountain road for about a mile back to the parking lot.  Before you hit the parking lot make sure you look off to your slight left and catch a glimpse of the top of Silver Cascade Falls.  That describes the loop, which is best if you're alone or short on time.  I recommend linking this trail into one of the other nearby trails to make a longer ride.  Also, if you decide to ride the trail in the opposite direction, be prepared to yield to the uphill riders (who may flip you the bird for going the \"wrong\" way).  This trail makes for some really fun down hill if done in the opposite direction, but be sure to only do this during low traffic times (early morning during the middle of the week, and definitely not on a holiday) to avoid angry up hill climbers and hikers.",

The woods are beautiful and there are occasional views of notches in the mountains and the prairie beyond as well as fantastic rock formations.  There are ponderosas, firs, and great aspen stands.  After a few miles, the trail turns to doubletrack.  If you're a singletrack purist, turn around and enjoy the ride back to the car.  If you don't mind riding some gravel-laden doubletrack, continue on.  The secenry gets even better and there are wildflowers everywhere.  After about 3.5 miles, the \"trail\" heads straight up the side of a very steep mountain following the pipeline.  It is possible to do a loop here, but be warned, it gets dicey.  First, you will hit a good mile of the most brutally steep, bottomless gravel hike-a-bike you can imagine.  Your reward for the slog up the hill will be trying to find your way back to Gold Camp Road on trails that are not marked and seem to peter out in the most inconvenient places.  Bring a map and/or GPS, know how to use them, and be prepared for a longer-than-expected outing with some difficult route finding and most likely some bushwacking.  Once you find Gold Camp Road Follow it downhill to Old Stage to 371 and back to the start.  If you do decide to try the loop, you may want to consider doing it in reverse--there will still be a lot of route finding, but there will be less hike-a-bike.  ",

Beware if it's been raining as FS 371 requires a steep climb back out and there's some ruts, so a 2wd may have a rough time of it.  Be sure to take the right trail--from the third pullout, there's two trails--ignore the one above the pullout and take the one below--you'll know its the right one as there's a concrete slab partially concealing a pipeline.",

As you head counterclockwise, the singletrack by the campgrounds is smooth and fast (but watch for campers).  The further out you get, the rougher the singletrack gets.

None of the climbs are extended, and each climb seems to top out on a ridge with awesome views to the south and west. Switchbacks are manageable and I did not need to dismount at all during the ride.  The loop is about 3.3 miles and the \"trail\" which takes you to the loop is about 1.8 miles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also rode the Canyon trail from Mahogany East -- got about a mile and a half before I had to cruise out to beat a storm, but what I saw of Canyon it is beginner doubletrack (an old service road?) -- a bit sandy in spots, but not rocky.  Canyon will connect to Cheyenne Rim, which a Ranger had told me has amazing views.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA route the ranger recommended is (from the lower lot) Cheyenne Rim N to Canyon E to Mahogany S to Pronghorn S.
